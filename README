# Rossmann Prophet Forecast API

This project demonstrates a **time series forecasting API** for Rossmann stores using **Prophet**, with deployment on **Render**. The project also integrates MLOps practices, Dockerization, and CI/CD pipelines with **GitHub Actions**.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a **forecasting API** that predicts daily sales for Rossmann stores. The API accepts inputs such as promotions, holidays, and store ID, and returns future predictions.  

The project covers key steps in **ML engineering and MLOps**:

- Data processing and model training  
- Prophet model implementation  
- API development with FastAPI  
- Dockerization  
- Deployment on Render  
- CI/CD using GitHub Actions  

---

## Dataset

The data includes:

- `train.csv` – historical sales data  
- `test.csv` – sales test set  
- `store.csv` – store metadata  

**Train/Validation Split:** `2015-06-01`

## Modeling

The forecasting model uses **Prophet** and incorporates regressors:

- `Promo`  
- `StateHoliday`  
- `SchoolHoliday`  

Models are saved per store in the `models/` folder.

---

## API

The API is built with **FastAPI** and has the following endpoints:

- `GET /` – Health check, returns `{"status": "ok"}`  
- `POST /predict` – Returns future sales predictions for a given `store_id`  

**Example Request:**

```json
{
  "store_id": 1,
  "periods": 7,
  "Promo": 1,
  "StateHoliday": 0,
  "SchoolHoliday": 0
}

**Example Response:**
{
  "store_id": 1,
  "periods": 7,
  "predictions": [
    {"ds": "2015-05-31T00:00:00", "yhat": 4352.69},
    ...
  ]
}

Docker & Deployment

The project is containerized with Docker:

docker build -t rossmann-api .
docker run -p 8000:8000 rossmann-api


The API is deployed on Render:
https://prophet-forecast-api-mlops.onrender.com

GitHub Actions & CI/CD

CI/CD is implemented with GitHub Actions:

Run tests with pytest

Build Docker image

Optional: push to DockerHub

Optional: deploy to Render

Add screenshot of GitHub Actions workflow here

Usage

Send a POST request to /predict with the store ID and features.

Receive JSON response with future sales predictions.

Optionally add screenshot of API response or Streamlit interface here

Future Improvements

Add Streamlit interface to visualize predictions and graphs

Integrate all stores dynamically

Move trained models to Git LFS for easier version control

Add more regressors and model tuning

Implement authentication for the API
